This project serves two personal goals. 

1. for me to understand cpp basic features as templates and type deduction
2. for people to have a test enviroment for algo / coding problems they met durinng interview or from online sources.

Future feat: add LLM API and maybe some frontend user interface

useage: 

user need to 
1. self change the ./include/def.hpp part for the I/O data type;
2. the ./src/sample.cpp is for test cases. ./src/ref.cpp is the correct implementation of the coding problem.

3. users own implementation is in the ./src/user.cpp
